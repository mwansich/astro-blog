Welcome to my _new blog_ that i built for my CS50 final project! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished so far

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.

## To-Do
- [x] Tags and a tag index page
- [x] Understand and implement Astros Image features
- [x] Archive pages with pagination
- [x] Search function to search the blog posts
- [x] "Featured Posts" section on Homepage
- [x] Add more components and improve styling
- [x] More
